        you’re the one that gets it done. You’re charismatic and easy-going. 
        When people aren’t getting along, you help them find common ground and work together. 
        Some may say that you are a one-trick pony, but if the cake and its frosting don’t get mixed 
        smoothly then it doesn’t matter how good the knife, pan, and measuring cups are in other recipes. 
        You make the difference between a confectioner’s dream and a sugary brick covered in lumpy buttercream.`,

        When something needs doing and there’s no one else around, you can get the job done and look confident (if a little sloppy) while doing it. 
        Need to serve up some info at a board meeting? You got it, although a couple bits got dropped. 
        Need to stir some ideas together? That can be done, although some finer details are still not well-mixed. 
        A ticket was more than a person could handle? You can break it up, but the cut isn’t as smooth as it could be. 
        Sure, these tasks could be done with more finesse, but you’re always there and always willing to take on a challenge`,

        you can tell when it’s done and can smoothly transition yourself and your teammates to the next part. 
        You also have a knack for divergent thinking. When you’re stuck on a problem, you are more able to turn it over and over until a solution presents itself. 
        Sometimes this results in the project getting a little messy, especially if the flip wasn’t particularly clean. But at least you make sure that it gets done.`,

        description: `You are the delegator. You can look at the ingredients of a project and know just how to treat them before they can be developed and finalized. 
        You dice up steps the right amount, hand them off to the right team(mate)s, and step in when further division is needed. 
        You also know to be cautious in your actions; Cuts are often final, and those that aren’t almost always require the intervention of other utensils. 
        So long as you bear this in mind, you always have a fine product to serve up at the end.`,
